ParkerHouse Remodeling
===

This site was a rebranding and update project for the old website for [ParkerHouse Remodeling](http://www.parkerhouseremodeling.com).

The old site was built with poor code structure, no responsive behavior, and lacked Google tracking information. The new site includes:

- New branding at the top of the page.
- Responsive design down to 320px.
- Large photo gallery of previous work.
- More information about the company and the design process.
- More contact information.

The redesign was done by [Brian Bennett](http://ohheybrian.com).
